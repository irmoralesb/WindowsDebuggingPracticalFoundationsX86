Code and Executables for "Windows Debugging: Practical Foundation x86" book

Original Source Code and Executable can be found at: ftp://dumpanalysis.org/pub/WDPF/

I left the assemblies in order for anyone to follow the steps from the book.

Anyway the original projects are written in C or C++, I plan to add the same examples using differnt Programming Languages and make the same analysis.
